# Call-Center-Monthly-KPI

## ðŸ“š About The Data

This project uses the [Call Center Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/basharath123/call-center-dataset) from Kaggle to track employee performance and overall call metrics. The dataset contains information about daily call volume, resolution rates, satisfaction ratings, and employee performance.

Key fields include:
- Call Volume â€“ Total number of calls handled per day/week.
- Resolution Rate â€“ Percentage of calls resolved successfully.
- Satisfaction Rating â€“ Customer feedback scores (1â€“5).
- Average Call Length â€“ Duration of calls in minutes.
- Speed of Answer â€“ Average time taken by agents to pick up calls.
- Employee Metrics â€“ Calls handled, resolution performance, and CSAT per agent.

## Key Insights
- Mondays show the highest call volume, with Friday being the lowest.
- Overall monthly resolution rate is about 70%, with variation across employees.
- Most customers give high satisfaction ratings, but the occasional low scores point to areas where service can improve.
- A few agents consistently stand out with faster responses and higher resolution rates compared to others.

## Recommendations
- Reduce wait times by adjusting staffing on high-volume days (e.g., Mondays).
- Provide additional training for agents with lower resolution rates.
- Introduce quality checks and offer additional support where needed to improve customer satisfaction.
- Reward top-performing agents to keep morale high and encourage others to follow their example.

## Tools Used
